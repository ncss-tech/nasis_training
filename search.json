Select the legend in the legend table and click the Find Related for Selected Row button.\n\nA window appears, Use the drop-down button to select the target table containing the data you want to find, for this exercise, select Area and click ok. The choices in the drop-down menu will differ based on the table you are viewing and will only show choices for data having an existing relationship with the data in the table you are viewing.\nYou will notice the NASIS client will switch to the table containing the data and highlight the row of the related data. If the related table is not already open it will open it. It will also provide additional information in the status messages window and will show the original table, target table and provide the row id of the original row and related row. You can click these links in the status window to return to either the original or the related row. Take a screenshot of the Area table and save to send to your mentor.\n\n\n\nLoad Related Data\nWhen you have data loaded into your selected set, you can also load related data from the local database into the selected set using the load related for selected rows button:\n\nReturn to the Legend table and select the legend by clicking the row to highlight it. Click on the load related button and click on the down arrow to select NASIS User.\n\nIf the data is in the local database, you will see a window confirming your results:\n\nClick yes to add the results to your selected set. Notice you will need to open the NASIS User table to see the results of the load related action. Alternatively, you can also use the find related action. Take a screenshot of the NASIS User table and save to send to you mentor.\nIf no related records were found, you will see a different results window similar to this one:\n\nRemember this tool only works if the data exists and is in your local database. If it doesn’t return results do not assume there isn’t any related data – there might be related data, it just isn’t in your local database to load into your selected set.\n\n\nDownload Related\nThe download related button can be used in instances where you see “NOT IN LOCAL DATABASE” in the columns where data should be loaded. This situation could occur if you queried data from the national database, but did not choose to download all the related tables at the time of the query. To demonstrate this tool, we will need to remove some data from our local database. Click the “Setup Local Database” button to open the local database view:\n\nClick the mapunit tab and select Rec ID = 2761935, then click the exclude button, and then accept button.\nNow return to the legend table view. Expand the legend table to see the child tables by clicking the plus icon on the left. Notice there is a row that has “NOT IN LOCAL DATABASE” showing in some of the columns:\n\nThis corresponds to the row we just removed from our local database. To add it back to your local database select the row and use the download related button:\n\nA window will appear where you can confirm the request. Take a screenshot of this window and save to send to you mentor. You can also choose to add the data to your selected set by checking the box. Even though you might see the download related button is active on the toolbar, not all data is downloadable because it is not required unless you see “NOT IN LOCAL DATABASE” in the rows/columns where data should be. If the download related button does not work, then you will have to run a new query against the national database to get the data.\n\n\nSubmit Screenshots\nSubmit your screenshots by placing them in your exercise submission folder to complete the exercise.\nEnd of Exercise"

You will not be able to use the Editor until this is complete. Once the editor is configured it is possible to work in a disconnected mode, but the tasks you are able to perform are limited.\n\n\nLogin Window\nWhen you have successfully launched the NASIS Editor you will see a window appear which will either attempt to sign you in to the software automatically using desktop single sign-on, or you may need to select your sign-in method and enter the appropriate credentials. This could be using your LincPass card and PIN, or your eAuth username and password if you do not have a LincPass. If you do not have an account you can find additional instructions for requesting a NASIS account at the following site: https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/resources/education-and-teaching-materials/nasis-frequently-asked-questions. There is an alert in the login window indicating “You are using a browser that is no longer supported by USDA eAuthentication”. SPSD staff is aware of the alert, and there is no difference in functionality of the application at this time. The issue will be corrected in a future release of the NASIS client.\n\n\n\nInitialize the local database\nWhen the login completes successfully, you will see a message that you must first initialize the local database before you can start using the software. This will take some time to complete, be patient! You can continue to use your computer while this finishes and you can observe the progress by viewing the progress window. When the process completes, the editor will open and will be ready to use. The editor window will appear as below."

Notice the orientation of the triangle icon indicates whether the column is sorted in ascending (upright triangle) or descending (inverted triangle) order.\nPractice sorting multiple columns by holding down the shift key while clicking each column to sort. Take a screenshot of your custom sort and save to send to your mentor later, then clear your sorting by right clicking a column and selecting “Clear All Sorting”\n\n\nFiltering\nFiltering data can be done several different ways. Hover over a column name to see a funnel icon appear in the right side of the column name. Clicking the funnel will open a list of unique values contained in the data. At the bottom right of the list window, click and drag near the edge where the diagonal lines are to adjust and expand the view if the text is truncated. Select an item in the list to show only those rows of data that match that value. Select multiple values if needed by checking the boxes to the left of the named values and then clicking the ok button. Alternatively, you can cancel the operation by clicking the cancel button.\nPractice this filtering technique and take a screenshot of your filtered data and save it to send to your mentor later.\nWhen a filter is active you will see a grey bar at the bottom of the table viewer providing the column name and value that is being filtered. Use the checkbox to turn the filter on or off. Clicking the inverted triangle or on the text, opens a list of previously used filters to select, which entries can be deleted by clicking the red circle with an x which appears to the right after hovering over an entry. Remove the filter completely by clicking the x button on the left. You may also choose to edit your filter by clicking the “Edit Filter” button on the right. This will open the main filter editor. Right clicking the column name will also bring up a menu where you can select this filter editor.\nPractice adding additional filter criteria for the data using the editor. If you get stuck, ask a mentor for assistance. Take a screenshot of the filter editor with your additional filter criteria and save it to send to you mentor later.\nUse the auto-filter row by right clicking on the column name and selecting “Show Auto Filter Row”. A new row appears at the top of the table separated by a thicker gray line. The filter operates as you type the filter criteria into the column you wish to filter. The icon at the left of each column can be clicked to select the filtering method.\nPractice using the auto-filter row on the columns and take a screenshot of the filtered results and save to send to your mentor.\n\n\nSubmit Screenshots\nSubmit all your screenshots taken during the exercise by placing them in your folder in the exercise submission folder on Microsoft Teams and describe the sorting and filtering you completed.\n\n\nRemove Filters and Sorting\nBefore you continue, remember the filters and sorting you have done during the exercise will be retained until you decide to change them.
