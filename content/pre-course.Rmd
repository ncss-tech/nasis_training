### Request Support if Needed

If you are still unable to locate the NASIS Editor Client Software, it is possible it has not yet been installed on your computer. You should request installation assistance from an Information Technology Specialist via the OCIO Help Icon shortcut on the desktop or via the OCIO Help Icon on the windows taskbar. If you are not a USDA employee, you can find additional information on NASIS installation [here](https://new.cloudvault.usda.gov/index.php/s/xFTJabHiT45WDom).

## Login to NASIS and Initialize

### Network Requirement

The NASIS Editor requires a network or internet connection the first time it runs to configure and set up the local database. You will not be able to use the Editor until this is complete. Once the editor is configured it is possible to work in a disconnected mode, but the tasks you are able to perform are limited.

### Login Window

When you have successfully launched the NASIS Editor you will see a window appear which will either attempt to sign you in to the software automatically using desktop single sign-on, or you may need to select your sign-in method and enter the appropriate credentials. This could be using your LincPass card and PIN, or your eAuth username and password if you do not have a LincPass. If you do not have an account you can find additional instructions for requesting a NASIS account [here]("https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/tools/?cid=nrcs142p2_053551#accounts").

### Initialize the local database

When the login completes successfully, you will see a message that you must first initialize the local database before you can start using the software. This will take some time to complete, be patient! You can continue to use your computer while this finishes and you can observe the progress by viewing the progress window. When the process completes, the editor will open and will be ready to use. The editor window will appear as below.
