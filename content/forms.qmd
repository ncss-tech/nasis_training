## Exercise 7 - Use a Form to Compare Data

### Open Form

Open the form "COMP-Compare Horizons with depths" (found in SSRO_North_Central folder).

### Load Data

Load datamapunits from any survey area.

### View Data

Use the navigation buttons at the bottom of the form to change to another component.

Scan through until you find an error where depths do not match, or feature is missing in one of the tables. A properly populated component should have diagnostic features and parent material table data. Water and Restrictive tables are only populated if needed; compare these tables to the taxonomic class above.

### Screenshot

Submit a screenshot of the form and place it in your exercise submission folder to complete the exercise. If do not find any errors take a screen shot of the last componentÂ
